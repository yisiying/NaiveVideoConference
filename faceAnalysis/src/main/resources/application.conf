    # The LightArrayRevolverScheduler is used as the default scheduler in the
    # system. It does not execute the scheduled tasks on exact time, but on every
    # tick, it will run everything that is (over)due. You can increase or decrease
    # the accuracy of the execution timing by specifying smaller or larger tick
    # duration. If you are scheduling a lot of tasks you should consider increasing
    # the ticks per wheel.
    # Note that it might take up to 1 tick to stop the Timer, so setting the
    # tick-duration to a high value will make shutting down the actor system
    # take longer.

    # The timer uses a circular wheel of buckets to store the timer tasks.
    # This should be set such that the majority of scheduled timeouts (for high
    # scheduling frequency) will be shorter than one rotation of the wheel
    # (ticks-per-wheel * ticks-duration)
    # THIS MUST BE A POWER OF TWO!

    # that to happen. In case of timeout the shutdown of the actor system will
    # proceed without running possibly still enqueued tasks.
